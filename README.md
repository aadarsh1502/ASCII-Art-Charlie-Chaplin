# ASCII-Art-Charlie-Chaplin
ASCII art of Charlie Chaplin created using Python by mapping image shadows and highlights to text characters.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is created as part of Project I for the course **Python and Full Stack** at Lovely Professional University.  
The objective of this project is to generate an ASCII-style image of the famous personality **Charlie Chaplin** using core Python programming concepts.

The project converts visual intensity (shadows and highlights) into characters such as `.`, `@`, `%`, `*`, `#`, and other symbols to visually resemble Charlie Chaplin in text format.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Strengthen logical thinking using Python
- Apply loops and conditional statements
- Understand how images can be represented using characters
- Create a recognizable ASCII art without using advanced libraries

---

## 🛠 Python Concepts Used
- Nested loops
- Conditional statements
- String manipulation
- Functions
- Logical mapping of pixels to characters

---

## ⚙️ How the Code Works
1. The image is divided into rows and columns (matrix form).
2. Each position represents a pixel intensity.
3. Based on darkness or brightness, a specific character is chosen.
4. Facial features like eyes, hair, and shadow areas are handled using multiple conditions.
5. The final output is printed line by line to form the ASCII image.
